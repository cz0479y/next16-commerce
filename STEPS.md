# DEMO STEPS

## Setup and problem

- This is a e commerce demo app. The setup is the Next.js App Router, Prisma ORM and an Prisma Postgres DB, Tailwind CSS.
- Demo app. Ecommerce mimic. Everything here looks pretty decent. Home page, browse page, about page, login page, profile page.
- I have all my pages here. I'm using feature slicing to keep the app router folder clean and easy to read. Services and queries talking to my db.
- Purposefully added slowness to my data fetching.
- This is a regular next.js codebase, nothing fancy, however, keep in mind we have a good mix of static and dynamic content because of our user dependent features.
- Let's say the team here has reported issues with architecture and prop drilling, excessive client side JS, and lack of static rendering strategies leading to additional server costs and degraded performance.
- The goal here is to improve this regular Next.js codebase and enhance it with modern patterns, regarding architecture, composition, and caching capabilities, to make it faster, more scalable, and easier to maintain.
- (Improvements based on my exp building with server comp also and other codebases I have seen, and what devs commonly do wrong or struggle to find solutions for).

## Excessive prop drilling -> component level fetching and authProvider: app/page.tsx

- The first reported issue was with architecture and excessive prop drilling, making it hard to maintain and refactor features. Let's check out the home page.
- I'm noticing some issues. Fetching auth state top level, passing down to components and using it for conditional rendering. This is a common problem, making our components less reusable and composable, and the code hard to read.
- We don't need to fetch top level with server components. Maybe we tried to improve performance and share this to make the page faster, but that's not necessary, and we are blocking the initial load too. We can fetch inside components, and then utilize react cache() to avoid duplicate calls.
- Refactor to add reach cache, fetch inside components, improve structure: PersonalizedSection suspend, MembershipTile suspend general.
- If using fetch it's auto deduped.
- What about client WelcomeBanner, WelcomeBanner? Cant use my await isAuth. Always need this dep when using WelcomeBanner, forcing the parent to handle this dep, cant move this freely. This is a dep we will encounter forever into the future of our apps life. Passing it multiple levels down.
- Let's utilize a smart pattern. Add authprovider. Let's not await this and block the root page, instead pass it as a promise down, keep it as a promise in the client provider.
- Welcomebanner: Remove prop all the way down, rather read it with use() inside PersonalBanner. Now we need to suspend Personalbanner with GeneralBanner, ensuring we have a proper fallback and avoiding CLS, while promise resolves with use(). WelcomeBanner is now composable again.
- Same problem in our user profile, getting the logged in state of a user on the server and passing it to the client. Do the same refactor here, login button composable and easily reused somewhere else in the future.
- Let's see another example of prop drilling, this all products page.
- Here, tried to be efficient to avoid duplicate calls for my responsive view. But now, getCategories are tied to this page, and the loading state responsibility is on the page with loading.tsx.
- Big skeleton code, reusable skeletons but still, no content shown. Plus, categoryFilters has a redundant dependency, less composable.
- Call getCategories inside the CategoryFilters component, uses react cache() deduping, not a problem.
- Delete loading.tsx since no data fetch here anymore. Refactor the /all page to use individual skeletons inside page.tsx for the categoryFilters.
- Notice blocking in the network tab. The entire page is blocked on something. It's really hard to know where the blocking is coming from. This is a common problem. Turns out, its the ProductList data fetch, suspend this also.
- See the streaming in network tab and improved perceived performance as well as actual performance. Also our search is now accessible. We fixed it, but it's really hard to know where the blocking was coming from. Let's see later how we can improve this.
- Since our welcomebanner is composable again, let's add it here.
- Through that refactor we can now maintain good component architecture, reusable and composable by fetching inside components.

## Excessive client JS -> Client/Server composition: WelcomeBanner

- The next reported issue was excessive client side JS.
- Check out this client-side Pagination. Client side due to nav status with a transition. Preventing default. There are some new tools we can use to handle this very common use case better. Remove all client side code here and isPending. Lost interactivity.
- Replace with LinkStatus. A rather new nextjs feature, useLinkStatus. Like useFormStatus, avoid lack of feedback on stale navigation while waiting for the search param. See local pending state, using this also on the category links in the bottom here and the sort. Very small amount of client JS added, only what is needed for interactivity.
- Revisit the WelcomeBanner. It's dismissing this with a useState(), and it has a motion.div animation. Switched to client side fetching with useSWR just to make this interactive, multiple ways to fetch now with API layer, no types.
- Also, we break separation of concerns by involving UI logic with data. Instead, let's extract a client component wrapper, and use whats referred to as the donut pattern. Cut all except top line of comp. New file bannerContainer: use client here, rename, children, wrapper. We won't covert the content of this to client because it's a prop, could be any prop. It's a reference to server-rendered content.
- PersonalBanner remove use client and switch to server fetching getDiscountData, isAuth and return general, and Delete API layer, no longer needed. Export WelcomeBanner client wrapper with suspense.
- Still have an error. For the motion.div, this simple animation might still be forcing the entire banner to be client. Let's move this to a MotionWrapper component, that can be reused for other animations. Could also switch to a react view transition! Back to server components now.
- By the way, using this client wrapper pattern with a boundary provider. Turn on hydration mode, marking my components. Mark the boundary in Welcomebanner so we can mark this as client. Mark Container client, see the donut pattern visual. Notice other boundaries, like client side search, and these server side categories.
- I want to hide the excess categories if theres many. Notice the individual server components here. Let's do some RSC gymnastics. Replace div with ShowMore client wrapper and React.Children to maintain our separation of concerns, and reusability of the Categories component. Now, we have this interactive showmore wrapper. Notice the boundaries client and server, donut pattern again.
- The compositional power of server components, Categories is passed into this ShowMore, handles its own data. Both can be used all over the app. Not tied to only the ShowMore version.
- Donut pattern can be used for anything like this, i.e Carousels and more. Also using it for the modal, showcase modal boundary donut pattern again.
- Now we have a pretty good architecture and best practice RSC.

## Discuss dynamic issues

- The last reported issue was a lack of static rendering strategies leading to additional server costs and degraded performance.
- See build output: The entire app is entirely dynamic, problem is clear. Every page has a dynamic API dependency.
- This is preventing us from caching anything or using ISR, even though so much of the app is static.
- Wasting server resources constantly, quickly gets expensive. Crawlers will wait for this, and the QWV is not terrible, but it's slower than it needs to be and redundant. Why is this happening?
- The main culprit is actually this auth check in my layout. My header is hiding my user profile, which is using cookies, which is forcing dynamic rendering. Auth check in layout. Classic. Everything I do is now dynamically being run on the server.
- Even my non-user personalized content on my home screen like the featured product, I need to suspend too to avoid blocking the page, and even my about page which doesn't even have a dynamic API dep! Because remember, my pages are either be static OR dynamic.
- This is a common issue and something that's been solved before. Let's briefly see which solutions people might resort to do in previous versions of Next.

### Static/dynamic split

- Open new vs code branch and web browser deployed branch.
- Could make a route group. Move all static pages out, simple auth layout. Create AppLayout and pass it data from the auth layout.
- Show cache HIT about page. Good for apps with very clear static/dynamic page boundaries.
- Now we have additional layouts and deps to remember, and more complexity.
- And still, the home page is dynamic because of the recommendations and banner, and product page due to this save feature and dynamic reviews. These are important pages. What else can we try?

### Request context

- Open next vs code branch and web browser deployed branch. Here, I created a request context hidden URL param, that is being set in middleware, now called proxy. Encoded request context in the URL.
- We can generateStaticParams the different variants of loggedIn/nonLoggedIn state.
- Call this function instead of isAuthenticated now. Avoiding doing auth check in the components themselves.
- This is actually a common pattern, and is also recommended by the vercel flags sdk using a precompute function. And used by i18n libraries.
- Client side fetch with useSWR the user specific stuff on the product page, and the reviews because we want them fresh, cache HIT.
- Passing lot's of props now from the server side params, losing compositional benefits.
- But, hassle API Endpoints. Pages routes flashbacks.
- And it's even more complex and we're even breaking the sweet new feature typed routes! Need this as Route everywhere. And what about the home page, do we need to client side fetch everything here too?
- It's a viable pattern. Useful for things like feature flags and more regardless etc, , but I don't feel smart enough for this, and let's say we are not interested in rewriting our app.

## Mark dynamic/static components

- What if we could avoid all of these tactics? Go back to real vscode.
- First', let's review the state of our app. Let's go back to our banner on the Home page.
- Mixing static and dynamic rendering here, nice pattern to avoid CLS. Mark them both. Toggle the rendering boundary, see the dynamic static.
- What about these other ones? Hero, FeaturedCategories, FeaturedProducts.
- Hero.tsx is async, but doesn't depend on dynamic APIs. In a dynamic route, its slow. In a static, its fast. Mark hybrid, also notice mark on FeaturedCategories, FeaturedProducts.

## Excessive dynamic rendering -> Composable caching with 'use cache'

### Home page

- Now, everything here that's marked as hybrid can be cached. It's async and fetching something, but it does not depend on dynamic APIs, so we can share it across multiple users. Notice how right now its loading on every request.
- Enable cacheComponents. This will opt all our async calls into request time calls, and also give us errors whenever a dynamic API does not have a suspense boundary above it.
- Add "use cache" to the Hero to cache this. Now it's non longer running on the server. Add cacheTag for reval. Mark it as "cached". We can remove this suspense boundary and skeleton. Worry less about millions of skeletons. See it's no longer loading.
- (One cache key linked to components, no hassle revalidating many different pages).
- We are no longer bound to page level static/dynamic rendering.
- Do the same for the FeaturedProducts and FeaturedCategories: use cache and mark, remove suspense. Now they're all cached, no longer loading on every request. Only thing that loads is the personalized content.
- That's why my pattern in the home page is good for both composition and caching. I already refactored it alot, and it's making it alot easier for me, letting me cache bigger chunks here.
- And every cached segment will included in the statically generated shell from Partial Prerendering, cached on the CDN. PPR goes down as far as the cache goes, until it meets a dynamic API, like the WelcomeBanner or the PersonalizedSection.

### All page

- See the rest of the boundaries pre-marked on other pages: all products. Categories and products. We can cache this too.
- On reload though, error from nextjs, search params doesn't have a suspense above it, remember it's a dynamic API. I can either add back the loading.tsx from before, or shift this page more towards static.
- Dynamic is a scale, and it's up to us to decide how much static we want.
- Refactor to resolve deeper down. Now I have a bigger static shell, because the searchparams dont prevent this content from being statically generated anymore. Error gone, suspended by the product list.
- Also, we are getting help identifying blocking calls, which is often a problem in large codebases not already following best practises.
- Keep my Products hybrid, because I want them fresh.
- Add use cache to the CategoryFilters, remove suspense, mark cached.
- Add use cache to the Categories, remove suspense, mark cached.
- Can only use cache async functions, but since we already use the donut here it’s not a problem for the ShowMore, allowing us to cache more content as well as getting compositional benefits.
- See initial load, big static shell, only product list loads.

### Product page

- Let's finally tackle the product page, also pre-marked with boundaries.
- Add "use cache" to Product, mark cached, remove suspense, it's no longer loading on every request.
- Try add use cache to the product page. It fails, exposing our dynamic API. Why? We have a dynamic dep. A pretty cool optimistic save product button, showing the saved state of that product for the user. This is also useful for debugging btw. Instead of importing the dynamic dep, slot as children, and interleave it. We can still cache the productDetails itself! Children reference can change without affecting the cache entry. Donut pattern, but for caching. Cache gymnastics. We could also cache the data, but this is a showcase.
- Remove details suspense, add the suspense there with Bookmark!
- Now, we can cache the ProductDetails, no longer loading on every request. Small chunk of dynamic content only, pushed the loading state all the way down.
- Keep the Reviews hybrid, want them fresh.
- Final error in product page, no cache above params. We will still see this params resolve in the deployment, it's inside params, so it can't be static. Either we add a loading.tsx, or we can use generateStaticParams. Add an example generateStaticParams for a few products. Now it will ready for those, then cached as it's generated by users. The error is gone. Pick what is best for your use case and data set.
- For incrementally adopting cacheComponents, we would need to start high up with a dep, then build down and refactor out our dynamic APIs.
- Done with the codebase refactor. My route tree is primarily the same. Just changing a few things to better follow RSC best practice and optimization and adding caching.

## Final demo

- I added cache here to all components cachable.
- See the initial page loads. Almost my entire home page is already available. Only the personalized section and banner load. Navigate to the all products page, then the product page.
- Again, every cached segment will be a part of the statically generated shell from Partial Prerendering, giving us this extreme performance.
- In prod, in client side navs, shell can also be prefetched for even faster navigations, i.e categories. Params are already known for all links on the page.
- We don't see the params of the product on client side navs, because they're already known. And for full page, they're cached at the CDN edge after first generation.
- Remember i have purposefully added slows, and i didn't optimize my db. With just a few code changes and smart patterns, we improved performance drastically, reduced server costs by caching much more content, and improved maintainability with better architecture and less prop drilling.
- There is no reason to be avoiding dynamic APIs anymore. There is not static and dynamic pages. No weird hacks or workarounds or multiple data fetching strategies or client fetching. Every data fetch is server components!
- In modern Next.js, we can have one paradigm and one mental model, performant and composable by default.
