# DEMO STEPS

## Setup and problem

- This is a e commerce demo app. The setup is the Next.js App Router, Prisma ORM and an Prisma Postgres DB, Tailwind CSS.
- Let's say the team here has reported issues with architecture and excessive passing of props, excessive client side JS, confusion around when to use suspense boundaries, and need help utilizing static generation and caching.
- Demo app. Ecommerce mimic. Everything here looks pretty decent. Home page, browse page, login page, about page, profile page. Pretty good overall.
- I have all my pages here. I'm using feature slicing to keep the app router folder clean and easy to read. Could also use the underscore components. Services and queries talking to my db.
- Also using typed routes to get these page props and type safe links.
- The goal here is to improve this regular Next.js codebase and enhance it with modern patterns, regarding architecture, composition, and caching capabilities, to make it faster, more scalable, and easier to maintain.
- Improvements based on my exp building with server comp also and other codebases I have seen, and what devs commonly do wrong or struggle to find solutions for.

## Excessive prop drilling -> component level fetching and authProvider: app/page.tsx

- Team reported issues with architecture and excessive prop drilling, making it hard to maintain and refactor features. Let's check out the home page. Maybe we tried to be smart and share this to make the page faster.
- I'm noticing some issues. Fetching auth state top level, passing down to multiple components, conditional rendering. This is a common problem, making our components less reusable and composable.
- We don't need to fetch top level with server components. We can fetch inside components,and then utilize react cache() to avoid duplicate calls. Refactor to fetch inside components, improve structure. If using fetch it's auto deduped.
- Let's see another example, this all products page. Here, tried to be smart to avoid duplicate calls. But now, CategoryFilters are tied to this page, and the loading state responsibility is on the page.
- Big skeleton code, reusable skeletons but still, no content shown. CategoryFilters has a redundant dependency.
- Call getCategories inside the CategoryFilters component, add react cache() deduping, not a problem.
- Refactor the /all page to use individual skeletons inside page.tsx.
- Notice blocking in the network tab. The entire page is blocked on the ProductList data. This is a common problem. It's really hard to know where the blocking is coming from. Turns out, its the ProductList data fetch, suspend this also.
- See the streaming in network tab and improved perceived performance as well as actual performance. We fixed it, but it's really hard to know where the blocking is coming from. Let's see later how we can improve this.
- What about client components? In our header, getting the logged in state of a user on the server and passing it to the client. Always need this dep when using loginButton, forcing the parent to handle this.
- Add authprovider. Let's pass it as a promise down, keep it as a promise in the provider. LoginButton is now composable again. Spoiler: we'll get back to this component here in the layout.
- Keep component architecture reusable and composable by fetching inside components.

## Excessive client JS -> Client/Server composition: WelcomeBanner

- Another reported issue is excessive client side JS. Let's check out this banner.
- Begin with this Banner. It's dismissing this with a useState(), and it has a motion.div animation. Switched to client side fetching with useSWR to make this interactive.
- However, we break seperation of concerns by involving UI logic with data. Instead, let's utilize the donut pattern to make a client component wrapper, BannerContainer.
- Delete API layer, no longer needed.
- See in devtools only the container is client.
- By the way, using this pattern with a boundary provider. Wrap a boundary here so we can mark this as client. Hard code "hydration". See the links as well client. Mark as client.
- For the motion.div, this simple animation is now forcing the entire banner to be client. Let's move this to a MotionWrapper component, that can be reused for other animations.
- Compositional power, WelcomeBanner can be added anywhere. Add to /all page.
- For component that don't rely on server logic and neither on client js, let's mark them hybrid. Pagination.
- What if we want a modal for our products? Mark product as server. Relies on server stuff and is async. We can utilize for example the modal pattern with intercepting routes, or pass the content as props.
- Add snippet passing down server component into a ProductModal. Mark modal as client.
- The compositional power of server components, Product is passed into this modal, handles its own data.
- Composable components like this product and product details that handle their own data fetching, that can be used all over the app. Avoid lots of prop passing from page level.
- Continue with my links in the categories footer. Using a rather new nextjs feature, useLinkStatus. Like useFormStatus, avoid blocking navigation while waiting for the search param.
- I want to hide the excess categories if theres many. Let's do some RSC gymnastics. Use ShowMore client wrapper and React.Children to maintain our separation of concerns, and reusability of the Categories component. Mark the boundary.
- Extracting client logic to smaller client components, like this search.
- Showcase all boundaries. Donut pattern can be used for anything like this, i.e Carousels and more.

## Discuss dynamic issues

- Now we have a pretty good architecture and best practice RSC.
- However, I have a problem. My entire app is entirely dynamic. Showcase build output.
- Why? This is preventing me from caching anything or using ISR, even though so much of my app is static.
- Wasting server resources constantly, quickly gets expensive. Crawlers will wait for this, and the QWV is not terrible, but it's slow and redundant.
- The culprit is actually this auth check in my layout. My header is hiding my user profile, which is using cookies, which is forcing dynamic rendering. Auth check in layout. Classic. Everything I do is now dynamically being run on the server.
- Even my non-user personalized content, which I need to suspend this too now to avoid blocking the page, and even my about page which doesn't even have a dynamic API dep! Because remember, pages could either be static OR dynamic.
- Even if i add client side caching with staletimes, it wont help a lot. Even though im doing everything right with Server Components.
- This is a common issue and something that's been solved before. Let's briefly see what we could do.

### Static/dynamic split

- Open new vs code branch and web browser deployed branch. About page is fully static, let's make a route group. Move all static pages out, simple auth layout. Create AppLayout and pass it data from the auth layout. Now we have additional layouts and deps to remember, and more complexity.
- Show cache HIT about page. Good for apps with very clear static/dynamic page boundaries.
- And still, my product and home page is dynamic because of the recommendations. These are important pages. What else can we try.

### Request context

- Open next vs code branch and web browser deployed branch. Here, I created a request context hidden URL param, that is being set in middleware. Encoded request context in the URL. Avoiding doing auth check in the components themselves.
- We can generateStaticParams the different variant.
- Show cache HIT about page. This is actually a common pattern, and is also recommended by the vercel flags sdk using a precompute function. And used by i18n libraries.
- Client side fetch the user specific stuff on the product page, and the reviews because we want them fresh, cache HIT. UseSWR! Endpoints. Pages routes flashbacks. And also, we can't generateStaticParams thousands of products.
- But it's even more complex and we're even breaking the sweet new feature typed routes! Need this as Route everywhere. And what about the home page, do we need to client side fetch everything here too?
- Passing lot's of props now from the server side params, losing compositional benefits.
- My brain is already breaking. But still, viable pattern. Useful for flags etc, but let's say we are not interested in rewriting our app.

## Mark dynamic/static components

- What if we could avoid all of these tactics? Go back to real vscode.
- First', let's review the state of our app. Let's go back to our banner.
- This Suspense is causing CLS. Let's mark this and make it one composable WelcomeBanner. Update the other page as well. No more CLS, weaving static and dynamic rendering here.
- Categories.tsx is a hybrid component without use cache. In a dynamic route, its slow. In a static, its fast.
- Refactor our main page better to push dynamic data down. LoggedIn using the toast pattern to avoid CLS. Mark the segments as dynamic. We are utilizing cache(), so there's no problem calling this many times. Composition, no weird prop passing to try and speed things up in the root.
- Hard code the toggle to "rendering". See the rest of the boundaries pre-marked.

## Excessive dynamic rendering -> Composable caching with 'use cache'

- Now, everything here that's marked as hybrid can be cached. It's async and fetching something, but it does not depend on dynamic APIs.
- Enable cache components. This will opt all our async calls into dynamic calls, and also give us errors whenever a dynamic API does not have a suspense boundary.
- We have an error right away! The authprovider... Theres no way to fix this without lots of refactor. I suppose we remove this pattern. OR! Let's not await this, and read it with use() inside components. As long as it's suspended, no issue! Like params.
- Add "use cache" and cacheTag to the categories. Now it's fast on both about and home, we can remove this suspense boundary and skeleton. Worry less about millions of skeletons.
- One cache key linked to components, no hassle revalidating many different pages.
- No longer page level static/dynamic. And every cached segment will be a part of the statically generated shell from Partial Prerendering, and can also be prefetched for even faster navigations, cached on the CDN. That's why pushing my searchParams down like this will give me the biggest PPR shell.
- That's why my pattern in the home page is good for both composition and PPR.
- Add "use cache" to the category filters. Error, search params resolving too high: don't, or use client comps! Need to create a bigger static shell. Remove suspense.
- Add "use cache" to all hybrid components after the home refactor. Hero, FeaturedProducts, FeaturedCategories. Now they're all fast. Remove suspense.
- Add use cache to the Reviews, with cacheLife seconds. Keep the suspense.
- PPR goes down as far as the cache goes, until it meets a dynamic API.
- For the Product, it's inside params, so it can't be static. But, we can still use generateStaticParams. Add an example generateStaticParams.
- And also use "use cache: remote" to cache it between requests to avoid some server load. Inside dynamic API, we still need to add suspense.
- Can only use cache async functions, but since we already did the donut here it’s not a problem for the modal.
- Try add use cache to the ProductDetails. It fails, exposing our dynamic API. Why? We have a dynamic dep. This is also useful for debugging btw. Mark it as dynamic, and slot the dynamic dep.
- Then, error again! Actually, there is no suspense here, and we would be blocking our entire page! Add suspense.
- Let's do some cache gymnastics. Weave in dynamic data. Same as donut pattern, let's slot this. Composable caching. This is whats happening all over our app with pages and layouts.
- Still, warning. Every await is now dynamic. The user saved product gives us the suspense warning. This error is caused because my cookies are not suspended. At least now I'll now I wont be blocking any pages. A common problem is not knowing why your app feels slow, with cacheComponents, we will be notified where we need a suspense boundary.
- We could continue this across the whole app, not changing anything in our component tree and structure.
- Our authProvider does not make it dynamic as long as the components using it are suspended, just like searchParams!
- For incrementally adopting, we need to start high up with a dep, then build down. Or use the plain useCache, but for future proofing, consider cache components.
- My route tree is primarily the same, no refactors. Just following RSC best practices and adding caching. And doing gymnastics if I want to optimize, but thats totally voluntary. Every data fetch is server components! One paradigm, one mental model, composable by default.

## Final demo

- See all boundaries, cached stuff. Initial page loads. Almost my entire page is already available.
- Again, every cached segment will be a part of the statically generated shell from Partial Prerendering, and can also be prefetched for even faster navigations.
- And with static shell prefetching, we don't see the params of the product on client side navs, because they're already known. We see them only on the initial load here, after that the remote cache handles it.
- Show revalidation working with cacheTag.
- Follow best practices and it should all just work out the box, giving you max performance.
- There is no reason to be avoiding dynamic APIs anymore. There is not static and dynamic pages. Just performance and composition by default.
